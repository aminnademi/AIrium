### **User Story: AI Character Interaction**

#### **Title:** As a user, I want to interact with AI characters so that I can have meaningful conversations and build relationships with them.

---

#### **Description:**
As a user of the interactive virtual town, I want to engage in natural, non-linear conversations with AI characters. The characters should have distinct personalities, and their responses should be context-aware and dynamically change based on previous interactions. This will allow me to form relationships with the characters, create unique experiences, and explore various narrative paths within the virtual environment.

---

#### **Acceptance Criteria:**
- **AC1:** The AI characters should be able to engage in dynamic, multi-turn conversations.
- **AC2:** The conversation system should be powered by advanced language models (e.g., GPT-4 or Llama) to generate responses based on the context of prior interactions.
- **AC3:** Each AI character should have a unique personality and response patterns (e.g., friendly, sarcastic, thoughtful).
- **AC4:** The user should be able to initiate conversations with AI characters at any time within the virtual town.
- **AC5:** The AI characters should provide relevant responses based on the user’s input and the character’s predefined traits (e.g., a government character may give different responses compared to an environmental activist).
- **AC6:** Conversations should be persistent, meaning if the user leaves and returns, the AI characters remember previous interactions and respond accordingly.
- **AC7:** The conversation system should handle interruptions and context-switching, where a user can start a new topic without the conversation breaking down.

#### **Steps to Implement:**
1. **Design AI Character Profiles:**
   - Define personality traits, background, and default dialogue for each character.
2. **Integrate Language Models:**
   - Utilize GPT-4 or Llama to power the natural language processing for conversations.
3. **Create Conversation Management System:**
   - Develop a dialogue flow engine that ensures conversations are non-linear and contextually relevant.
4. **Implement Real-time Interaction:**
   - Ensure users can interact with AI characters in real-time, with minimal delay.
5. **Persistence of Conversations:**
   - Implement a backend system to store conversation history and ensure continuity across sessions.
6. **Testing:**
   - Test interactions for coherency, context-appropriateness, and natural flow.
